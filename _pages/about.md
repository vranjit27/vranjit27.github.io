## Cryptography • Privacy • Security

My research focuses on the design and analysis of provably secure systems, with recent projects spanning LLM watermarking, MEV-driven DeFi, universal payment channels, and secure multiparty computation.

I'm currently a Research Scientist at Visa Research. Previously, I was at Microsoft Research, held post-doctoral positions at MIT CSAIL and Technion, and earned my Ph.D. from the University of Maryland.

I've been fortunate to have been mentored by Jonathan Katz, Vinod Vaikuntanathan, Yuval Ishai, Vlad Kolesnikov, Juan Garay, and C. Pandu Rangan.
