## Cryptography • Privacy • Security

My research focuses on the design and analysis of provably secure systems, with recent projects spanning LLM watermarking, MEV-driven DeFi, universal payment channels, and secure multiparty computation.

I'm currently a Research Scientist at Visa Research. Previously, I was at Microsoft Research, held post-doctoral positions at MIT CSAIL and Technion, and earned my Ph.D. from the University of Maryland.

I've been fortunate to have [incredible mentors](/mentors/) and have had the pleasure of [mentoring many talented individuals](/mentees/).
